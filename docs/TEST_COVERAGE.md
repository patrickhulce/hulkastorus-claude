## Test Features

### Mocking Strategy

- **Prisma ORM**: Comprehensive mocking of all database operations
- **Authentication**: Mock auth service with various user scenarios
- **R2 Storage**: Mock cloud storage with error simulation
- **Time**: Consistent date mocking for reliable tests

### Test Utilities

- **Performance measurement**: Execution time and memory tracking
- **Error simulation**: Database, network, and service failures
- **Data generation**: Realistic test data with edge cases
- **Concurrent testing**: Race condition and load simulation

### Security Testing

- **Input validation**: Malformed JSON, type mismatches, missing fields
- **Injection attacks**: SQL, NoSQL, XSS payload testing
- **Path traversal**: Directory traversal attempt prevention
- **Authorization**: Owner-based access control validation
- **Rate limiting**: Rapid request handling

## Coverage Gaps and Recommendations

### Areas with Lower Coverage

1. **R2 Client** (17.5% coverage)
   - Network error handling
   - Retry mechanisms
   - Connection pooling

2. **Authentication Integration**
